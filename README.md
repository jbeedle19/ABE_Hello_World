# Module One: Hello World
## Description
A simple 'Hello World' application to practice hosting an application on my own remote server. In this module I created the remote server using a DigitalOcean droplet and bought a domain name, technical-tracks.xyz, from NameCheap in order to host my application publicly and allow users to visit.
